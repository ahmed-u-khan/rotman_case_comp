## tableau workbook

[HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ahmed.khan1711/viz/rotman_case_comp) is a starter tableau workbook with all the data loaded. Simply download the workbook and either edit it with [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) or [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop). 

Tableau Public is free to use and it uses a web ui/client which can be sometimes a bit clunky.

Tableau Desktop is the smoother and full-power version of Tableau Public and while it isn't free, you can download it as a free trial for 15 days or use it for free for 1 year if you're registered as a student.
